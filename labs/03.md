## part A: user environments and exception handling

#### Exercise 2 In the file env.c, finish coding the following functions:

```
env_init()
	Initialize all of the Env structures in the envs array and add them to the env_free_list. Also calls env_init_percpu, which configures the segmentation hardware with separate segments for privilege level 0 (kernel) and privilege level 3 (user).
env_setup_vm()
	Allocate a page directory for a new environment and initialize the kernel portion of the new environment's address space.
region_alloc()
	Allocates and maps physical memory for an environment
load_icode()
	You will need to parse an ELF binary image, much like the boot loader already does, and load its contents into the user address space of a new environment.
env_create()
	Allocate an environment with env_alloc and call load_icode load an ELF binary into it.
env_run()
	Start a given environment running in user mode.

As you write these functions, you might find the new cprintf verb %e useful -- it prints a description corresponding to an error code. For example,

	r = -E_NO_MEM;
	panic("env_alloc: %e", r);

will panic with the message "env_alloc: out of memory".
```
