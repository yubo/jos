<h1>Homework: boot xv6</h1>

<p>Submit your solutions before the beginning of the next lecture to the <a
 href="https://ccutler.scripts.mit.edu/6.828/handin.py/">submission web site</a>.

<h2>Boot xv6</h2>
Fetch the xv6 source:

<pre>
$ mkdir 6.828
$ cd 6.828
$ git clone git://pdos.csail.mit.edu/xv6/xv6.git
Cloning into xv6...
...
$
</pre>

Build xv6 on Athena (e.g., ssh -X athena.dialup.mit.edu):
<pre>
$ add -f 6.828
$ cd xv6
$ make
...
gcc -O -nostdinc -I. -c bootmain.c
gcc -nostdinc -I. -c bootasm.S
ld -m    elf_i386 -N -e start -Ttext 0x7C00 -o bootblock.o bootasm.o bootmain.o
objdump -S bootblock.o > bootblock.asm
objcopy -S -O binary -j .text bootblock.o bootblock
...
$ 
</pre>

<p>If you are not using Athena for 6.828 JOS labs, but build on your own
machine, see the instructions on <a href="../tools.html">the tools page</a>.  If
you have a build infrastructure on your own machine for lab 1, then you should
be able to use that infrastructure for building xv6 too.

<h2>Finding and breaking at an address</h2>

Find the address of <code>_start</code>, the entry point of the kernel:
<pre>
$ nm kernel | grep _start
8010b50c D _binary_entryother_start
8010b4e0 D _binary_initcode_start
0010000c T _start
</pre>
In this case, the address is <code>0010000c</code>.

<p>
Run the kernel inside QEMU GDB, setting a breakpoint
at <code>_start</code> (i.e., the address
you just found).
</p>

<pre>
$ make qemu-gdb
...
$ gdb

+ target remote localhost:26000
The target architecture is assumed to be i8086
[f000:fff0]    0xffff0:	ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
+ symbol-file kernel
(gdb) br * 0x0010000c
Breakpoint 1 at 0x10000c
(gdb) c
Continuing.
The target architecture is assumed to be i386
=> 0x10000c:	mov    %cr4,%eax

Breakpoint 1, 0x0010000c in ?? ()
(gdb)
</pre>

The details of what you see are likely to differ from the above output.

<h2>Exercise: What is on the stack?</h2>

Look at the registers and the stack contents:

<pre>
(gdb) info reg
...
(gdb) x/24x $esp
...
(gdb)
</pre>

<p>Write a short (3-5 word) comment next to each non-zero value on the stack
explaining what is.  Which part of the stack printout is actually the stack?
(Hint: not all of it.)

<p>You might find it convenient to consult the files bootasm.S, bootmain.c,
and bootblock.asm (which contains the output of the compiler/assembler).
The <a href="../reference.html">reference page</a> has pointers to x86 assembly
documentation, if you are wondering about the semantics of a particular
instruction.  Here are some questions to help you along:

<ul>

<li>Start by setting a break-point at 0x7c00, the start of the boot
  block (bootasm.S). Single step
  through the instructions (type si to the gdb prompt). Where in bootasm.S is
  the stack pointer initialized?

<li>Single step through the call to <tt>bootmain</tt>; what is on the stack now?

<li>What do the first <it>assembly</it> instructions of bootmain do to the
stack? Look for bootmain in bootblock.asm.

<li>Look in bootmain in bootblock.asm for the call that changes <tt>eip</tt> to
  </tt>0x10000c</tt>.  What does that call do to the stack?
  
</ul>

<div class="question">
<p><b>Submit</b>: The output of <tt>x/24x $esp</tt> with 
the valid part of the stack marked plus your comments..</p>
